# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

###The front end page of the code is deploy in git hub https://rrzk23.github.io/WilsonZhu-sPortfolio/
###The back end is host and deploy in render at https://wilsonzhubackend.onrender.com/
###Detail of how to implement each page is at {some confluence blog}.

This is a personal portfolio code by Wilson Zhu which include the briefy introduction, skills, education, work experience, portfolio
and a submit form to contact with me.

###Tech Stack:
    - React (HTML, CSS, javascript)
    - Node.js (nodemailer, .env, validator)
    - Git
    - ChatGPT

###Purpose
The purpose of making this website is to make this as my second CV to better view my skills in a responsive website.
Also since I am studying the computer science that mainly less involve in the front end and web related field. Doing this 
website help me learnging while doing it.

###Design
For each page it has a navigation bar to each different route and it has a page that display the corresponding content.
The Home page and About page is initially code in only html, css and javascript without any other resources. Then it is 
recoded to React so it may need some further refactor.

###Home
In Home page it is a welcoming page with a button to the git hub repository and my CV.
###About me
For About page it is the briefy introduction of me and the skill, expreience and education that I have.
###Portfolio
For portfolio page it is a gallery of my projects that completed in school and in my free time. Each porfolio photo
is reponsiable you can move your mouse on it to see the short description of the portfolio and clicking it can move to 
the page that describe each project.
###Contact
The contact me page is a form that will inform me once you submit the form to me. I will contact you ASAP. The page is also a
pratice for me to learn how to really connect the front end code with the back end web server.
